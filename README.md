# Air Quality Map
air-quality-map is a project created by Chase Ingebritson and Chase Lau for Dr. Tommy's CISC 375 course at the University of St. Thomas in Minnesota.

### Purpose
The goal of this project is to use Angular.js to create an interactive web page in which users can visualize an area and its air quality index. Users can either input a location or interact with the map and they will be shown air quality measurements for that area.

### Thanks
